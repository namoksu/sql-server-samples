# NodeJS Express4 REST API that uses SQL/JSON functionalities 

This project contains an example implementation of NodeJS REST API with CRUD operations on a simple Todo table. You can learn how to build REST API on the existing database schema using NodeJS, Express4, and new JSON functionalities that are available in SQL Server 2016 (or higher) and Azure SQL Database.

## Before you begin

To run this sample, you need the following prerequisites.

## Run this sample

1. Navigate to the folder where you have downloaded sample and run **npm install** in command window.

2. From SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools connect to your SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL database and
execute setup.sql script that will create and populate Todo table in the database.

3. Locate db.js file in the project, change database connection info in createConnection() method to reference your database. the following tokens should be replaced:
 1. SERVERNAME - name of the database server.
 2. DATABASE - Name of database where Todo table is stored.
 3. USERNAME - SQL Server login that can access table data and execute stored procedures.
 4. PASSWORD - Password associated to SQL Server login.

```
    var config = {
        server  : "SERVER.database.windows.net",
        userName: "USER",
        password: "PASSWORD",
        // If you're on Azure, you will need this:
        options: { encrypt: true, database: 'DATABASE' }
    };
```

4. Run sample app from the command line using **node app.js**
 1. Open http://localhost:3000/todo Url to get list of all Todo items from a table,
 2. Open http://localhost:3000/todo/1 Url to get details about a single Todo item with id 1,
 2. Send POST, PUT, or DELETE Http requests to update content of Todo table.

## Sample details

This sample application shows how to create simple REST API service that performs CRUD operations on a simple Todo table.
NodeJS REST API is used to implement REST Service in the example.
1. app.js file that contains startup code.
2. db.js file that contains functions that wrap Tedious library
3. todo.js file that contains action that will be called on GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE Http requests.

Service uses Tedious library for data access and built-in JSON functionalities that are available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.
